It was Safari caching. Chrome works fine. This is still not what I expected. If the djembe is 12p and the dundun is 16p I expected to see a grid of 48 notes per measure; the LCM of where they line up. I also don't expect the beats and divisions to control the grid; I expected the cycles to control the grid. It is still valuable to see the western translation though. I don't know what to do. The cycle guides are helpful but not prominent enough visually. I am also worried that a grid of 48 notes won't display on a mobile device nicely (without horizontal scrolling). I currently have the beat set to 6 with 16th notes which is only half the notes and I can't read it on my mobile device.

I think I would like to be able to turn western notation on and off. If it's on; it's just a visual cue for students. It would be driven by the feel of the cycles somehow; maybe allow the user to choose 16th/triplets like we do now and replace beats/divisions and call it something else.
